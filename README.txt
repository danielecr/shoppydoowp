== Description ==

Display a list of available (in bbplanet) receiptive structure
(hotel,b&b, appartments, residence, agriturism) in an article.

Insert the right tag in the article and with this plugin
activated it will be listed all structure available from
bbplanet.net feed 

== Installation ==

Copy this folder in directory wp-content/plugins/ of your wordpress

Make sure the script can write the cache directory, have a look
via ftp, in doubt set it to 777

== Upgrade ==

I am experiencing some problem, deactivate and reactivate the module
should fix those. Be carefull, just make a backup of table data
(prefix_category_ext_feed), deactivate plugin, then reactivate.
Thus if data about feed is not available anymore, just replace
the table.


== Changelog ==

= 0.1 =
* initial release (only readme)
